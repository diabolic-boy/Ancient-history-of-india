    <p>Ancient Indian architecture is known for its diversity, influenced by various dynasties and religions. Early examples include rock-cut caves and stupas, such as the Sanchi Stupa, built for Buddhist rituals. Hindu temple architecture flourished with distinct styles like the Nagara (North India) and Dravida (South India) styles, featuring intricate carvings and towering spires. Mauryan architecture saw the rise of monumental structures, including the Ashokan Pillars. The Gupta period is often regarded as the golden age, where temples, sculptures, and elaborate decorative motifs became prominent.</p>
