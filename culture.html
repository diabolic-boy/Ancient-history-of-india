    <p> The culture of ancient India was deeply rooted in religion, philosophy, and art, with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism playing key roles. Sanskrit was the primary language for literature, philosophy, and religious texts like the Vedas and Upanishads. Society was organized into a caste system, with rigid social structures but also a rich tradition of festivals and rituals. Art and architecture flourished, with intricate temple designs, sculptures, and music. Education and learning were highly valued, with centers like Takshashila and Nalanda becoming renowned hubs of knowledge.</p>
