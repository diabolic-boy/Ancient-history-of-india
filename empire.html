    <p> Ancient India witnessed the rise of several powerful empires that shaped its culture, politics, and economy. The Maurya Empire (c. 321–185 BCE), under Chandragupta and Ashoka, was the first to unify large parts of the subcontinent. The Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE) is considered a golden age, excelling in art, science, and literature. Earlier, the Magadha Kingdom played a key role in the rise of Jainism and Buddhism. The Chola and Satavahana empires were influential in South India, known for trade, temple architecture, and maritime power. Each empire contributed to the rich tapestry of Indian civilization.</p>
