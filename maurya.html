    <p> The Maurya Era (c. 321â€“185 BCE) was a powerful period in ancient Indian history, founded by Chandragupta Maurya. Under Emperor Ashoka, the empire reached its zenith, covering most of the Indian subcontinent. Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism and promotion of non-violence and Dharma significantly influenced Indian culture. The administration was highly centralized, with a well-organized bureaucracy and a strong army. After Ashoka's reign, the empire gradually declined due to internal strife and external invasions.</p>
